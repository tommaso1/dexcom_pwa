# Dexcom Readings viewer

Notice: This is not a medical app and should therefor NOT be used by any mean to take any medical decision. I decline every responsability on it both on the data / security and on the relaiablility of the data presented. Use at you own risk.

## What it is

This serves the double purpose of allowing me to try svelte out and to have a date associated to my glucose readings (because the dexcom official app does not allow it).  
It also shows the standard deviation and the average of the last 12 hours (hopefully). Well to be honest it just shows the average of the last 150 readings, that should be 12 hours, but if for some reason your phone was disconnected from the internet during that time it
won't be too much reliable, but it's a statistic, statistics are unreliable by default. 

There also are a lot of cool animations.
